Titanic Survival Prediction using Regression
The Titanic disaster in 1912 remains one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
In this project, we aim to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, gender, and passenger class.

This is a beginner-friendly project to learn:

Data loading and exploration
Data cleaning
Feature engineering
Machine learning model building
Model evaluation
